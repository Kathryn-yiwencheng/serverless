## Goal 
The goal is to provide a use case to explain the benefits for clients considering AWS serverless architecture with the modern MLOps concept.

## Structure
The project includes three parts:
* Section 1: A ETL sample with data pipeline
* Section 2: Technical discussion includes data lake, serverless, and modern MLOps
* Section 3: A serverless architecture sample expands the section 1 sample data.

## Note
* Section 1 is a directory that includes the sample data set and the SQLite data created after ETL.
